## Genesis takes the output of popular programs such as Admixture and EIGENSTRAT and produces good quality pictures, which the user can interactively change. There are first class tools that can be used to create good quality pictures, but they require expertise to use and best used when one already knows exactly what the output should look like. In practice there is a huge need for an interactive tool.
