### Managing space while running R sessions 

 R studio uses the home directory as the default work directory. Due to the increasing demand for computing resources, we have a spike increase in users. As a shared resource, there is a need for each user to manage their data appropriately to avoid denying services to others.
  
  - The following practices while uploading data using the R studio interface while creating a better space usage
  - All users home directory will be limited to 100GB
  - users will host their data in the data partition (store data that you are actively using) 
  - Users will use scratch or (user)home partition as their output and working directory
