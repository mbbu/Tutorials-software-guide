Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

Docker uses Dockerfile as base to create images which run as containers virtualized on the kernel.

Images take alot of space and each user using docker in their workflow should ensure deletion of stopped containers on the HPC.
